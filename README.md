 Exploring Air Quality Through Data Visualization and Machine Learning! 🚀

Today, I’m excited to share an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to analyze air pollution data and uncover valuable insights. This project leverages data science techniques, including statistical analysis, visualizations, and machine learning, to examine the impact of pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and CO on air quality and health risks.

With features like:

Summary Statistics and Missing Value Analysis 📊
Interactive Visualizations for pollutants and seasonal trends 📈
Health Risk Assessments 🩺
Correlation and Outlier Detection 🔍
Machine Learning Model Training for air quality prediction 🤖
This dashboard empowers users to explore complex relationships in environmental data effortlessly.
